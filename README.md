And the main feature of the program - the ability to make a picture from puzzles automatically. 
The algorithm does not compare the puzzles with the desired result, because it receives only the images of the parts.

The automatic solving algorithm compares the colors of the pixels on the edges of the puzzles to find the best neighbors.
